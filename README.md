This MOD will force all ListViews to use FastScroll!
FastScroll is a feature built into Android that allows you to drag the scrollbar thus allowing you to quickly scroll!
It can be seen in apps like People!
This mod forces EVERY ListView in EVERY app to have FastScroll on!

This is very useful for apps with long lists, these are some i find it very helpful in:
WhatsApp chats list
Super Backup
Xposed Installer download list
I'm sure there is more
